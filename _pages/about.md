I am currently a third-year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Technology at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST).
In Fall 2024, I participated in an academic exchange at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) of [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Switzerland.


Research Interests
------

I am generally interested in Natural Language Processing. More specifically, I focus on advancing **logical reasoning**  and **discovery & exploration** capabilities in **large language models** (LLMs). 

Recently, I co-authored a paper ([The Curse of CoT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05081)) on LLM logical reasoning (currently under review at COLM 2025) under the supervision of [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/).

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
