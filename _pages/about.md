I am currently a final year undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Technology at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) (HKUST).
In Fall 2024, I participated in an academic exchange at the School of Computer and Communication Sciences (IC) of [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/) (EPFL), Switzerland.

Currently, I am engaged in independent study under the supervision of [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) and working on my final year thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Yi R. (May) Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/).

Research Interests
------

I am generally interested in Natural Language Processing. More specifically, I focus on advancing the **logical reasoning**, **scientific discovery**, and **agentic exploration** capabilities of Large Language Models.

<!-- In October this year, I published a paper titled *Self-Redraft*, aiming to elicit intrinsic exploration–exploitation balance in test-time scaling for code generation, submitted to ACL ARR 2025 (October cycle). -->

Currently, under the supervision of [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), I am building an interactive environment for **generalizable scientific discovery**.

This summer, I am conducting research on **AI for code generation** for my Final Year Thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Yi R. (May) Fung](https://mayrfung.github.io/). Through this experience, I gained hands-on experience in **supervised fine-tuning** and **reinforcement learning**.

In Spring 2025, I co-authored a paper [The Curse of CoT](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05081) on LLM **logical reasoning** (accpeted to TMLR) under the supervision of [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/).

Feel free to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
